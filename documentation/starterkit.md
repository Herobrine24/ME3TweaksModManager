| Mod Name                            | The name of the mod, shown in Mod Manager. When importing a mod, this name will also be used                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Should not be more than 60 characters, to avoid causing filesystem issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mod Developer                       | The listed name of the developer.

| Mod Website                         | Web page link that shows up at the bottom of the description panel for mods. These should typically be pointed to your NexusMods mod page. If you don't have one yet, you can premake one by getting through at least the first screen on NexusMods new mod page, and then viewing the page. | Must be a valid URL. If linking to NexusMods, it must point to a mod page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DLC Folder Name (suffix)            | The name that is suffixed to 'DLC_MOD_', to create your DLC mod folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Should not be more than 30 characters, to avoid causing filesystem issues. In LE3, the name cannot contain the case-sensitive string 'MP'. All mods must have unique DLC folder names, if different mods ship with different names, the later released one(s) will be blacklisted from import.                                                                                                    |
| Internal Name                       | The internal name of your mod. This will be written into the generated TLK files, with the id defined by Internal Name TLK ID. This is used by some features such as LE1 and LE3 Settings Menu starter kit addins.                                                                           | While rarely seen, it should match the name of your mod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Internal Name TLK ID                | The TLK ID used to store Internal Name at. Typically you can pick a random number above 10 million and you should be fine.                                                                                                                                                                   | In Game 2 and 3, strings following this will be split to male/female, so pick a number higher than the string range you want to use. It should be unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mount Priority                      | The mount priority of the mod, which determines the order DLC mounts in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Must be unique and greater than 0. The maximum value is different per game. Mods that many other mods will depend on should mount lower, mods that others will not depend on should mount higher. Higher mounted mods should provide patches for lower mounted mods that have conflicts. Mods should avoid mounting at either end of the valid range unless they have valid reasons for doing so. |
| Module Number (Game2 only)          | The number that is associated with your mods TLK file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Must be unique and between 0 and 65535                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mount Flag (Game 2 and Game 3 only) | Controls various features related to your DLC, such as save-dependency. In LE, the other flags are not really necessary, except for LoadsInSingleplayer for LE3.                                                                                                                             | No restrictions. Unless your mod really needs to always be present when loading a save, you should never pick save game dependency, as it is very inconvenient for users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mod Description                     | The description shown for your mod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Cannot be empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Starter Kit can also add some useful features to your mod, such as a blank startup file, squadmate outfit merge files that are ready to edit, blank 2DA tables, and data for PlotManager, depending on which game you are generating your DLC for.
